# Gradient Descent

## Overview

This repository documents my personal exploration and hands-on work with **gradient descent optimization and linear regression** using Python. It includes direct implementations, data visualizations, and example notebooks created for learning and demonstrationâ€”as a focused study on core machine learning topics, *not as a large-scale or production project*.

## Key Features

- **Learning-oriented:** All content highlights personal experimentation and understanding of gradient descent, linear regression, and related data analysis techniques.
- **Python Implementation:** Scripts and Jupyter notebooks feature stepwise code, clear comments, and modular structure for readability.
- **Visualization:** Detailed plots illustrate algorithm behavior, loss minimization, and regression results.
- **Reference Data:** Includes small sample CSV files to support tests and visualization.

## Contents

- **Gradient Descent from Scratch:** Python functions and visualizations tracking loss over iterations.
- **Linear Regression:**  
  - Manual from-scratch calculation  
  - Implementation using `scikit-learn`
- **Data Plots:**  
  - Regression lines  
  - Loss landscapes  
  - Data distribution charts
- **Sample Datasets:** Ready for use in the included notebooks.

## How to Use

1. **Clone/Download** this repository.
2. Open provided **Jupyter notebooks** or run Python scripts in your local environment.
3. Experiment with code, data, and parameters to build a practical intuition for these algorithms.

## Intended Audience

- Learners, students, and developers wishing to see clear, hands-on examples of key ML algorithms
- Anyone seeking reference implementations of gradient descent or linear regression in Python

## Note

This repository is a focused showcase of work on this specific topic; it is not designed as a production library or large research package.
